            My name is Alex Hristov. I am a student of 11th grade, majoring in Software and Hardware Sciences at NPMG, Sofia. Sofia.

			About myself I can say that I am fast, team-working, communicative, ambitious, patient. My best qualities are responsibility, efficiency, punctuality, adaptability, honesty and aspiration for development.

			Since 5th grade I started programming. Immediately after my admission to NPMG I started participating in IT Olympiads. In 8th grade, I started getting further into the IT field. I now have about 5 years of programming experience and I find it cool to develop projects that I can help people with, like in this case.
